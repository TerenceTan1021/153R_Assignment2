Symbolic Uncondition Music Generation
- Similar as using Markov Chain for Symbolic Music Generation in Homework 3. We are following a similar approach, and are using n-gram Models
- n-gram Models is quite similar, as they are to predict the next notes in sequence based on the previous (n-1) notes. As we know Markov Chain is a "First-Order" Model, only considering the previous 1 note to predict the next note
- it doesn't have to be note prediction, as there are many othher symbolic representation we could use.
